## 2026-10-16 — Filter pills close on Escape and outside presses

- New `regent_ui/assets/js/pill_select.mjs`: an open `details.rg-pill-select` menu
  closes on Escape, handing focus back to its summary when focus was inside it, and on
  a press anywhere outside it. Patchbay's R5 read found the menu stayed open.
- `mix regent_ui.assets` copies it next to the other browser modules; a site imports it
  once from its `app.ts`. `STYLE.md` and `CONSUMERS.md` say so.
- This file starts here.
